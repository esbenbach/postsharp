A small collection of aspect, some of which are useful some of which are not.
They are provided as is, intended to be used in your own code, 
or as a compiled library if you wish - thats entirely up to you.

Most of the code here is used in production in some for or another.

There are no guarantees everything works as planned, most likely there is a bug or two.
Let me know if you find them and I will attempt to fix them.
